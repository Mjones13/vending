Total Tests: 164  
- Failed: 48
- Passed: 116

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Browser API Polyfills Test (`__tests__/polyfills/browser-api-polyfills.test.ts`)

**Failed Tests: 1**

#### Test: "should persist through test cleanup cycles"
- **Error**: `requestAnimationFrame is not defined after cleanup`
- **Issue**: RAF polyfills are being cleared during test cleanup cycles
- **Root Cause**: The `ensureRAFPolyfills()` function in jest.setup.js is not being called consistently after cleanup

### 2. Timer Helpers Test (`__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx`)

**Failed Tests: 5**

#### Test: "flushAllTimersAndMicrotasks - should flush all pending operations"
- **Error**: Expected "timer" but received "microtask"
- **Issue**: Execution order of timers vs microtasks is not as expected

#### Test: "setupFakeTimers - should configure fake timers with custom options"
- **Error**: `useFakeTimersSpy` not called with expected options
- **Issue**: Spy is not capturing the jest.useFakeTimers call

#### Test: "setupFakeTimers - should use default advanceTimers=true"
- **Error**: `useFakeTimersSpy` not called
- **Issue**: Same as above - spy not capturing calls

#### Test: "setupRealTimers - should restore real timers"
- **Error**: `useRealTimersSpy` not called
- **Issue**: Spy not capturing jest.useRealTimers call

#### Test: "cleanupTimers - should clear fake timers and restore real timers"
- **Error**: `clearAllTimersSpy` not called
- **Issue**: Spy not capturing jest.clearAllTimers call

### 3. Logo Stagger Animation Test (`__tests__/animations/logo-stagger.test.tsx`)

**Failed Tests: 1**

#### Test: "should trigger animations in staggered sequence"
- **Error**: `ReferenceError: AnimationTimingTester is not defined`
- **Issue**: Missing import for AnimationTimingTester from keyframe-testing utilities

### 4. Home Page Test (`__tests__/pages/index.test.tsx`)

**Failed Tests: 8**

#### Test: "should cycle through all rotating words"
- **Error**: Expected "Apartments" but received "Workplaces"
- **Issue**: Word rotation not progressing as expected within timeout

#### Test: "should apply correct animation state classes"
- **Error**: Timeout waiting for animation class changes
- **Issue**: Animation state transitions not occurring within expected timeframe

#### Test: "should maintain text alignment with static text"
- **Error**: Test implementation issue (needs fixing)

#### Test: "should have proper container dimensions to prevent cutoff"
- **Error**: Test implementation issue (needs fixing)

#### Test: "should render hero image with proper alt text"
- **Error**: Image element not found in DOM

#### Test: "should have contact phone number link"
- **Error**: Phone link element not found

#### Test: "should have proper image alt texts" (Accessibility)
- **Error**: Images without proper alt text found

#### Test: "should have accessible buttons and links" (Accessibility)
- **Error**: Buttons/links missing proper accessibility attributes

### 5. Rotating Text Animation Test (`__tests__/animations/rotating-text.test.tsx`)

**Failed Tests: 3**

#### Test: "should update text content during component state changes"
- **Error**: Text not changing from initial word within timeout
- **Issue**: Animation cycle not progressing

#### Test: "should handle React key prop changes for component re-mounting"
- **Error**: Word not changing from "Workplaces"
- **Issue**: Component not cycling through words

#### Test: "should transition through all CSS classes without getting stuck"
- **Error**: Only 1 state transition recorded, expected >= 3
- **Issue**: Animation state machine not progressing through all states

### 6. Rotating Text Alignment Test (`__tests__/animations/rotating-text-alignment.test.tsx`)

**Failed Tests: 7 (All tests failing)**

#### Common Error: "Element not ready within timeout"
- **Issue**: `waitForElementReady` function timing out for all tests
- **Root Cause**: Elements not becoming "ready" according to the criteria in alignment-testing.ts

### 7. Rotating Text Cycling Test (`__tests__/animations/rotating-text-cycling.test.tsx`)

**Failed Tests: Multiple (exact count not determined)**

#### Issues Found:
- **Warning**: "Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `fill`"
- **Warning**: "Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `priority`"
- **Error**: Trying to use fake timers without calling `jest.useFakeTimers()`
- **Issue**: Test setup problems with timer configuration

### 8. Rotating Text Timing Test (`__tests__/animations/rotating-text-timing.test.tsx`)

**Failed Tests: Multiple (test suite crashes)**

#### Critical Error: "Maximum call stack size exceeded"
- **Location**: KeyframeAnimationTester in keyframe-testing.ts
- **Issue**: Circular reference causing infinite recursion in destroy/cancel/notifyPhaseChange methods
- **Root Cause**: The destroy method calls cancel, which calls notifyPhaseChange, which triggers a listener that calls destroy again

## Common Patterns

### 1. React Act() Warnings
Multiple tests showing act() warnings for state updates not wrapped in act():
- Home component setAnimationState calls
- Timer-based state updates

### 2. Timer Configuration Issues
- Tests expecting fake timers but running with real timers
- Inconsistent timer setup between test files
- Timer helper spies not working correctly

### 3. Animation Timing Issues
- Elements not transitioning states within expected timeframes
- Rotating text not cycling through words
- Animation classes not being applied

### 4. Import/Reference Errors
- Missing imports (AnimationTimingTester)
- Circular dependencies in utility files

### 5. DOM Element Issues
- Elements not found in rendered output
- Incorrect attribute values (boolean instead of string)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Critical Issues First**:
   - Resolve circular dependency in KeyframeAnimationTester
   - Fix RAF polyfill persistence issue
   - Add missing AnimationTimingTester import

2. **Standardize Timer Usage**:
   - Ensure consistent timer setup across all animation tests
   - Use setupRealTimers() for interval-based animations
   - Fix timer helper spies

3. **Fix React Warnings**:
   - Wrap all state updates in act()
   - Fix boolean attribute warnings (fill, priority)

4. **Update Test Implementations**:
   - Fix alignment test timeout issues
   - Update home page tests to match current DOM structure
   - Ensure proper test cleanup

5. **Review Animation Timing**:
   - Increase timeouts for animation tests
   - Verify animation cycle timing matches implementation
