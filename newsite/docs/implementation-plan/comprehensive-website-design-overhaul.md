# Comprehensive Website Design Overhaul Implementation Plan

## Branch Name
`comprehensive-design-overhaul`

## Background and Motivation

The current Golden Coast Amenities website, while functional, suffers from significant design quality issues that detract from the professional image of the business. After thorough analysis, key problems include:

- **Massive inline styled JSX blocks** making maintenance difficult and bundle sizes large
- **Inconsistent design patterns** across pages with varying quality levels  
- **Basic typography** with poor hierarchy and non-professional fonts
- **Outdated design aesthetics** lacking modern, professional polish
- **No design system** leading to inconsistent spacing, colors, and components
- **Poor visual hierarchy** making content hard to scan and consume
- **Suboptimal performance** due to inline styles and lack of optimization

The business operates in B2B enterprise sales serving companies with 150-25,000 employees, requiring a sophisticated, trustworthy appearance that reflects quality service delivery.
