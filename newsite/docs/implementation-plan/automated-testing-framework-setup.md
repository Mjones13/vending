# Implementation Plan: Automated Testing Framework Setup

## Background/Motivation

Currently, the Golden Coast Amenities website lacks automated testing, which makes it difficult to ensure reliability as new features are added. The user has requested a comprehensive testing setup that covers components, animations, and follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.

## Key Challenges

1. **Framework Selection**: Choose testing tools that work well with Next.js Pages Router, TypeScript, and CSS animations
2. **Animation Testing**: Complex challenge to test CSS animations and timing-based interactions
3. **TDD Integration**: Establishing workflow where tests are written first, then implementation follows
4. **Test Organization**: Creating maintainable structure that scales with the project
5. **Human-Readable Tests**: Ensuring tests are self-documenting and easy to understand

## Technical Approach

### Testing Stack Selection
- **Jest + React Testing Library**: Unit and component testing
- **Playwright**: End-to-end and visual testing
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Extended DOM matchers
- **jest-environment-jsdom**: DOM environment for Jest

### Animation Testing Strategy
- Use `waitFor` and custom matchers for CSS class changes
- Test animation states rather than exact timing
- Mock animation durations for faster test execution
- Visual regression testing for complex animations

### Test Organization Structure
