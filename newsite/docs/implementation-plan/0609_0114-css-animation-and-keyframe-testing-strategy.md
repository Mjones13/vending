# Implementation Plan: CSS Animation and Keyframe Testing Strategy

**Branch**: `css-animation-keyframe-limitations`  
**Created**: June 9, 2025 at 01:14 AM  
**ID**: 0609_0114

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All work for this implementation plan MUST be done on the `css-animation-keyframe-limitations` branch.  
> Before starting any work, ensure you are on the correct branch: `git checkout css-animation-keyframe-limitations`

## Background/Motivation

JSDOM, the DOM implementation used by Jest, doesn't support CSS animations or provide a CSS engine. This limitation causes significant challenges when testing components that rely on CSS animations, transitions, or keyframe animations. Currently:

- `getComputedStyle` doesn't return accurate animation properties
- Keyframe animations don't execute
- Can't test visual animation states
- Animation timing and state transitions can't be verified

This implementation addresses the CSS animation testing limitations by implementing a three-tier testing strategy that separates logic testing, behavior testing, and visual validation.

## Key Challenges

1. **JSDOM Limitations**: No CSS engine means no animation execution, no computed styles for animations, and no keyframe support
2. **Test Reliability**: Need to test animation behavior without relying on visual rendering
3. **Performance**: Real timers for animations can make tests slow; need balance between accuracy and speed
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Must clearly separate what can be tested in unit/integration tests vs what requires E2E testing

## High-Level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Create Animation Testing Utilities
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Create animation state testing utilities for logic-only tests
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Create behavior testing utilities that work with real timers
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Create mock CSS animation properties for getComputedStyle
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: Document the three-tier testing approach for the team

### Phase 2: Refactor Existing Animation Tests
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Identify and categorize existing animation tests by tier
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Refactor rotating text tests to use new utilities
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Refactor logo stagger animation tests
- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Fix tests that rely on visual animation properties

### Phase 3: Create E2E Animation Tests
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Set up Playwright tests for visual animation validation
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Create E2E tests for critical animations (rotating text, logo stagger)
- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Document which animation aspects require E2E testing
- [ ] **Task 3.4**: Update CI/CD to run E2E animation tests separately

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach:

**Three-Tier Testing Strategy:**

1. **Tier 1 - Unit Tests (Logic Only)**
   - Test animation state machines and logic without visual rendering
   - Use hooks testing for animation state management
   - Mock timers for predictable state transitions
   - Focus on: state changes, callbacks, lifecycle events

2. **Tier 2 - Integration Tests (Behavior Focus)**
   - Test component behavior with real timers
   - Verify DOM changes and text content updates
   - Use waitFor with appropriate timeouts
   - Focus on: user-visible changes, component integration

3. **Tier 3 - E2E Tests (Visual Validation)**
   - Use Playwright for actual CSS animation testing
   - Verify computed styles and animation properties
   - Test visual smoothness and timing
   - Focus on: visual correctness, performance, cross-browser

### Key Requirements:
- Animation tests must be categorized into appropriate tiers
- Each tier must have clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Tests must be fast enough for CI/CD (tier 1/2 < 5s per test, tier 3 < 30s)
- Documentation must be clear for developers to choose correct tier

### Dependencies:
- Jest and React Testing Library (existing)
- Playwright for E2E tests (may need to add/configure)
- No new runtime dependencies for the application

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] All animation tests are categorized into appropriate tiers (1, 2, or 3)
- [ ] Animation state logic can be tested without CSS rendering
- [ ] Component behavior changes are testable with real timers
- [ ] Visual animations are validated through E2E tests

### Quality Requirements:
- [ ] No more test failures due to missing CSS animation support
- [ ] Clear documentation guides developers to correct testing approach
- [ ] Test utilities are reusable across different animation types
- [ ] Existing animation tests are refactored to use new approach

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] Tier 1 tests execute in < 1 second each
- [ ] Tier 2 tests complete within 5 seconds each
- [ ] E2E animation tests run in < 30 seconds per test
- [ ] Overall test suite execution time doesn't increase by more than 20%

## Project Status Board

### Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Phase**: Planning

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Implementation plan creation | ✅ Complete | Plan created with timestamp ID 0609_0114 |
| Requirements analysis | ⏳ Pending | [Add status updates here] |
| Phase 1 preparation | ⏳ Pending | [Add status updates here] |

### Next Steps:
1. Review existing animation tests to understand current pain points
2. Create the animation testing utilities starting with Tier 1
3. Write example tests demonstrating each tier's approach
4. Begin refactoring the most problematic tests (rotating text timeouts)

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
This implementation plan addresses a fundamental limitation of JSDOM by creating a structured approach to animation testing. The three-tier strategy allows us to test what's testable at each level while clearly documenting what requires real browser testing. This should significantly reduce animation-related test failures and timeouts.
