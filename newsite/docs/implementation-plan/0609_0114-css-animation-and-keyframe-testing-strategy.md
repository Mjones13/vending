> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All work for this implementation plan MUST be done on the `test-isolation-fixes` branch.  
> Before starting any work, ensure you are on the correct branch: `git checkout test-isolation-fixes`

> ✅ **UPDATE**: This plan has been revised to focus solely on CSS animation and keyframe testing limitations in JSDOM. Timer-related issues and act() warnings have been resolved in a separate implementation plan (0609_0028).

## Background/Motivation

JSDOM, the DOM implementation used by Jest, doesn't support CSS animations or provide a CSS engine. This limitation causes significant challenges when testing components that rely on CSS animations, transitions, or keyframe animations. Currently:

- `getComputedStyle` doesn't return accurate animation properties
- Keyframe animations don't execute
- Can't test visual animation states
- Animation timing and state transitions can't be verified

This implementation addresses the CSS animation testing limitations by implementing a three-tier testing strategy that separates logic testing, behavior testing, and visual validation.

**Specific Problems This Will Solve:**
- Tests failing because they expect CSS keyframe animations to execute in JSDOM
- Tests attempting to verify visual CSS properties that don't exist in JSDOM
- Animation tests relying on `getComputedStyle` for animation state detection
- Lack of clear testing strategy for separating animation logic from visual validation
- Missing utilities for testing animation state machines and hooks independently

## Key Challenges

1. **JSDOM Limitations**: No CSS engine means no animation execution, no computed styles for animations, and no keyframe support
2. **Test Strategy Clarity**: Need clear separation between what can be tested in unit tests vs what requires visual validation
3. **Animation Logic Testing**: Need utilities to test animation state machines and hooks independently of visual rendering
4. **CSS Property Mocking**: Need helpers to mock CSS animation properties for tests that check animation state

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach:

**Three-Tier Testing Strategy with Specific Implementation Patterns:**

1. **Tier 1 - Unit Tests (Logic Only)**
   - **What to test**: Animation state machines, hooks, callbacks, timing logic
   - **Tools**: `renderHook`, `AnimationStateMachine`, `testAnimationHook()`, existing timer utilities
   - **Pattern**: Test pure functions and hooks in isolation without component rendering
   - **Example**: Test word rotation logic, state transitions, timer callback functions
   - **Key principle**: No DOM rendering, no CSS dependencies, pure logic testing

2. **Tier 2 - Integration Tests (Behavior Focus)**
   - **What to test**: Component behavior, DOM changes, text updates, className changes
   - **Tools**: `render`, existing timer utilities, `mockAnimationProperties()` when CSS state needed
   - **Pattern**: Test full component behavior but avoid visual CSS validation
   - **Example**: Test that text content changes, CSS classes are applied, user interactions work
   - **Key principle**: Test what users see/interact with, not how it looks visually

3. **Tier 3 - E2E Tests (Visual Validation - Future)**
   - Currently out of scope for this implementation
   - Would use Playwright or similar for actual CSS animation testing
   - Would verify computed styles and animation properties
   - Focus would be on: visual correctness, performance, cross-browser

### Key Requirements:
- Animation tests must be categorized into appropriate tiers based on what can be tested in JSDOM
- CSS animation properties must be mocked for tests that need to check animation state
- Tests must not rely on CSS keyframe execution or computed style accuracy in JSDOM
- Clear documentation for developers on when to test logic vs behavior vs visual aspects

### Dependencies:
- Jest and React Testing Library (existing)
- Existing timer utilities from timer-helpers.ts (already implemented)
- No new testing frameworks or major dependencies
- No changes to production code

### Out of Scope:
- Fixing timer-related infinite loops (already resolved in implementation plan 0609_0028)
- Setting up Playwright or other E2E frameworks (deferred to future if needed)
- Modifying production animation code
- Creating complex animation mocking libraries
- Changing from Jest to another test runner

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] All animation tests are categorized into appropriate tiers (1, 2, or 3)
- [ ] Animation state logic can be tested independently without CSS rendering (Tier 1)
- [ ] Component behavior changes are testable without relying on visual CSS properties (Tier 2)
- [ ] CSS animation properties can be mocked for tests that need to check animation state
- [ ] No tests fail due to JSDOM's lack of CSS animation support

### Quality Requirements:
- [ ] Clear documentation guides developers on CSS animation testing strategy
- [ ] CSS mocking utilities are reusable across different animation types
- [ ] Existing animation tests are refactored to not rely on visual CSS execution
- [ ] Animation logic tests use hooks testing patterns for state management

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] Tier 1 tests execute in < 1 second each (logic only)
- [ ] Tier 2 tests complete within 5 seconds each (behavior focus)
- [ ] Tests no longer fail due to JSDOM CSS limitations
- [ ] Test suite reliability improves for animation-related components

### Next Steps:
1. Create CSS animation property mocking utilities for JSDOM limitations
2. Create animation state testing utilities for hooks and logic testing
3. Create keyframe animation testing utilities that don't rely on CSS execution
4. Begin refactoring tests to separate CSS concerns from functional behavior

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
This implementation plan addresses the fundamental CSS animation limitations of JSDOM by creating utilities and strategies specifically for testing animation logic and behavior without relying on visual CSS rendering. The plan has been updated to focus solely on CSS/keyframe issues, as timer-related problems have been resolved in implementation plan 0609_0028.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- CSS animation property mocking for JSDOM limitations
- Animation state machine and hooks testing utilities  
- Three-tier strategy for separating testable concerns
- Refactoring existing tests to not rely on CSS execution

This should eliminate test failures caused by JSDOM's lack of CSS animation support while maintaining comprehensive testing of animation functionality.
