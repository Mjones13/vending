# Implementation Plan: Test Isolation Problem Resolution

**Branch**: `test-isolation-fixes`  
**Created**: June 9, 2025 at 01:46 AM  
**ID**: 0609_0146

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All work for this implementation plan MUST be done on the `test-isolation-fixes` branch.  
> Before starting any work, ensure you are on the correct branch: `git checkout test-isolation-fixes`

## Background/Motivation

Our test suite is experiencing significant reliability issues due to test isolation failures. Tests that pass individually fail when run together, indicating insufficient cleanup between tests and shared global state. This represents 30% of our test failures and is blocking parallel test execution optimization.

**Problem Scope:**
- Tests passing individually but failing when run together
- State persisting between tests causing false positives/negatives
- Component mounting issues in parallel execution environments
- Shared global state contamination between test cases
- Insufficient cleanup procedures between test runs

**Business Impact:**
- Unreliable test results undermining confidence in code changes
- Slower development cycle due to test flakiness
- Inability to fully utilize parallel testing for faster CI/CD
- Developer time wasted investigating false test failures

## Key Challenges

1. **React State Update Warnings**: Timer-based animations trigger React state updates outside of act(), causing console warnings and unreliable test behavior
2. **RequestAnimationFrame Polyfill Loss**: Test cleanup utilities set RAF/cancelAnimationFrame to undefined, causing "not defined" errors in subsequent tests  
3. **CSS Animation Global Interference**: Animation testing utilities inject global styles that affect parallel tests running simultaneously

## High-Level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Fix React act() Warnings in Timer-Based Tests ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Wrap timer cleanup in jest.setup.js:271 `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()` with React act()
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Fix __tests__/animations/rotating-text.test.tsx waitFor calls to wrap timer-dependent state changes with act()
- [x] **Task 1.3**: Create test-utils/act-timer-helpers.ts with act()-wrapped jest.advanceTimersByTime utilities
- [x] **Task 1.4**: Update __tests__/animations/ files to import and use act-wrapped timer utilities

### Phase 2: Fix Animation Frame Polyfill Persistence ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Fix test-utils/parallel-isolation.ts:211-217 to use polyfill fallbacks instead of potentially undefined values
- [x] **Task 2.2**: Enhance jest.setup.js:203-213 RAF polyfill restoration to validate they exist before assignment
- [x] **Task 2.3**: Create RAF polyfill validation function that ensures global.requestAnimationFrame is never undefined
- [x] **Task 2.4**: Add afterEach validation in jest.setup.js to detect and restore missing RAF polyfills

### Phase 3: Fix CSS Animation Global State Interference ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Task 3.1**: Modify test-utils/keyframe-testing.ts enableAnimations/disableAnimations to use test-scoped style elements
- [x] **Task 3.2**: Replace global document.head.appendChild() with test-container-specific style injection
- [x] **Task 3.3**: Add unique test-id attributes to injected styles to enable scoped cleanup
- [x] **Task 3.4**: Update animation CSS cleanup to target only styles with current test's unique identifier

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach:
**Target Specific Root Causes** - Based on analysis of failing tests, focus on the 3 primary isolation problems: React act() warnings from timer-based state updates, requestAnimationFrame polyfill persistence issues, and CSS animation global state interference.

**Never Clear, Always Restore** - Instead of clearing global APIs, always restore them to known polyfilled implementations. Never set requestAnimationFrame or cancelAnimationFrame to undefined.

**Test-Scoped Resource Management** - Use test-specific identifiers and scoped resource cleanup rather than global DOM clearing. This prevents parallel tests from interfering with each other's resources.

### Key Requirements:
- Eliminate all React act() warnings from timer-based state updates in tests
- Ensure requestAnimationFrame polyfills never get set to undefined during cleanup
- Prevent CSS animation styles from one test affecting parallel tests  
- Maintain all existing test functionality and patterns
- Fix the specific failing tests: rotating text animations, layout scroll effects, hover transitions

### Dependencies:
- Current Jest configuration and setup files (jest.setup.js, jest.config.js)
- Existing test utilities in test-utils/ directory
- React Testing Library and Jest ecosystem compatibility
- Next.js framework globals and state management patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [x] __tests__/animations/rotating-text.test.tsx passes when run alone: `npm test -- rotating-text.test.tsx`
- [x] __tests__/animations/rotating-text.test.tsx passes in parallel: `npm test -- __tests__/animations/`
- [x] Layout and animation tests run without console errors when executed together
- [x] Zero React act() warnings in console output: no "update...was not wrapped in act()" messages
- [x] RAF functions always defined: `typeof global.requestAnimationFrame === 'function'` at test start

### Quality Requirements:
- [x] All existing animation tests maintain their current functionality and assertions
- [x] No test behavior changes - only isolation problems are fixed
- [x] CSS animation utilities work correctly in parallel without interference
- [x] Timer-based tests execute deterministically without timing conflicts
- [x] Test cleanup is scoped to individual tests rather than global clearing

### Performance Requirements:
- [x] No additional test execution overhead from isolation fixes
- [x] Animation test timing remains consistent and predictable
- [x] Parallel test execution speed maintained or improved
- [x] Memory usage stable - no leaks from RAF polyfill or CSS style accumulation
