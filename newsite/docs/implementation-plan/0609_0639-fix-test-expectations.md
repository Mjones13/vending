# Implementation Plan: Fix Test Expectations

**Branch**: `fix-test-expectations`  
**Created**: June 9, 2025 at 06:39 AM  
**ID**: 0609_0639

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All work for this implementation plan MUST be done on the `fix-test-expectations` branch.  
> Before starting any work, ensure you are on the correct branch: `git checkout fix-test-expectations`

## Background/Motivation

This plan addresses the fifth immediate fix from the test failure analysis: incorrect test expectations in timer helper tests. The tests have flawed logic about JavaScript execution order and broken spy setups.

**Affected File:**
- `__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx` - Timer helper utility tests with incorrect expectations

**Specific Issues:**
1. **Event Loop Understanding (lines 274-275)**: Test expects timers to execute before microtasks, but this is backwards - microtasks always execute before timers in the JavaScript event loop
2. **Broken Spy Setup (lines 339-395)**: Tests attempt to spy on `jest.useFakeTimers` function calls but the spy is never attached correctly 
3. **Non-functional Verification (lines 398-427)**: Tests for `setupRealTimers` try to spy on `jest.useRealTimers` but use the same flawed spy pattern

**Root Cause:** Tests are written to verify internal Jest function calls rather than testing the actual behavior and effects of the timer utility functions.

## Key Challenges

1. **Technical Challenge**: Rewriting test logic to verify actual behavior rather than internal Jest function calls, while maintaining test coverage and meaningfulness
2. **Testing Challenge**: Understanding correct JavaScript event loop execution order and designing tests that verify the actual effects of timer utilities rather than their implementation details
3. **Integration Challenge**: Ensuring test fixes don't break existing timer utility functionality or introduce timing-related test flakiness

## Atomic Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Fix Event Loop Expectation in flushAllTimersAndMicrotasks Test
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Correct the microtask vs timer execution order test expectation
  - **File**: `__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Update test logic around lines 274-275 to expect microtasks to execute before timers (correct JavaScript event loop behavior)
  - **Verify**: `npm test __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx -t "should flush all pending operations"` passes
  
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Improve test clarity by adding explicit timer advancement
  - **File**: `__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Modify the test to explicitly advance timers after verifying microtask execution (around lines 276-284)
  - **Verify**: Test demonstrates correct understanding of event loop order and still verifies timer functionality

### Phase 2: Fix setupFakeTimers Test to Verify Behavior Instead of Spying
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Replace spy-based test with behavior-based verification
  - **File**: `__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replace the broken spy test (lines 339-373) with functional tests that verify timer behavior changes
  - **Verify**: `npm test __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx -t "should configure fake timers with custom options"` passes

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Fix the default behavior test for setupFakeTimers
  - **File**: `__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Update the default behavior test (lines 375-395) to verify actual timer functionality instead of spying on Jest calls
  - **Verify**: `npm test __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx -t "should use default advanceTimers=true"` passes

### Phase 3: Fix setupRealTimers Test to Verify Behavior Instead of Spying
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Replace spy-based test with behavior-based verification for real timers
  - **File**: `__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replace the spy test (lines 398-427) with functional test that verifies real timer behavior
  - **Verify**: `npm test __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx -t "should restore real timers"` passes

    - [ ] Key insights: Event loop order, behavior vs implementation testing
    - [ ] Lessons learned: Always test behavior/effects rather than internal function calls
  - **Verify**: Entry exists with timestamp and complete information

### Verification Failure Protocol:
If any verification step fails:
1. **Analyze the failure** - Determine root cause of verification failure
2. **Document the issue** - Note what failed and why in implementation plan
3. **Choose response**:
   - **Simple fix**: Create additional task to address the issue
   - **Complex issue**: STOP and notify user with:
     - Specific failure details
     - What was attempted
     - Potential solutions identified
     - Request for guidance on how to proceed
4. **Do NOT mark plan complete** until all verifications pass

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach:
This fix focuses on correcting test logic rather than implementation code:
- **Phase 1**: Fix the fundamental misunderstanding of JavaScript event loop execution order
- **Phase 2**: Replace spy-based tests with behavior-based tests for setupFakeTimers
- **Phase 3**: Replace spy-based tests with behavior-based tests for setupRealTimers
- **Testing approach**: Each change immediately verified with specific test runs
- **Rollback plan**: If behavior tests fail, revert to previous logic and analyze the timer utility implementation

### Atomic Task Guidelines:
- **One File Rule**: All tasks modify only `__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx`
- **Line Specificity**: Include exact line numbers for modifications
- **Exact Changes**: Specify exact test logic changes and expected behavior
- **Clear Verification**: Each task verified by running specific test cases
- **Sequential Order**: Must fix event loop understanding before behavior tests
- **Final Verification Required**: All timer helper tests must pass

### File Organization:
Single file modification:
- `__tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx` - Contains all the failing timer helper tests
- No dependencies on other files (timer utilities themselves are working correctly)
- Tests are independent and can be fixed sequentially

### Dependencies:
- **Jest**: Already configured testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For component-based timer tests
- **Timer utilities**: Located in `test-utils/timer-helpers.ts` (implementation is correct)
- **No external dependencies required**: This is purely test logic correction

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] flushAllTimersAndMicrotasks test correctly expects microtasks before timers
  - **Verify with**: `npm test __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx -t "should flush all pending operations"` passes
- [ ] setupFakeTimers tests verify actual timer behavior changes
  - **Verify with**: `npm test __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx -t "setupFakeTimers"` all pass
- [ ] setupRealTimers test verifies actual timer behavior restoration
  - **Verify with**: `npm test __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx -t "setupRealTimers"` passes

### Quality Requirements:  
- [ ] Test logic follows correct JavaScript event loop understanding
  - **Verify with**: Test expectations align with microtasks executing before timers
- [ ] All tests use behavior-based verification instead of implementation spying
  - **Verify with**: No spy calls on internal Jest functions in timer tests
- [ ] Timer utility functionality remains unaffected
  - **Verify with**: Other tests using timer utilities continue to pass

### Final Verification Requirements:
- [ ] **ALL original objectives achieved** (all three failing test cases now pass)
- [ ] **Original problem completely resolved** (no more expectation errors or spy failures)  
- [ ] **No regressions introduced** (timer utilities work correctly in all contexts)
- [ ] **Implementation documented** (scratchpad.md updated with event loop insights)

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Verification:
- [ ] All tasks marked complete with checkboxes
- [ ] All verification commands show passing tests
- [ ] No "Expected: timer, Received: microtask" errors
- [ ] No spy-related test failures

### Final Verification Success:
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: All timer helper tests pass without failures
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Event loop understanding corrected in test expectations
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: All spy-based tests replaced with behavior-based tests
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Solution documented with event loop insights

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues:
1. **Timer utility changes needed**: If behavior tests reveal actual utility implementation issues
   - **Mitigation**: Analyze timer utility implementation and fix if necessary
2. **Test timing flakiness**: Real timer tests might be flaky in CI environment
   - **Mitigation**: Use appropriate timeouts and mock patterns for consistent testing

### Rollback Plan:
- **Individual test rollback**: `git checkout HEAD -- __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx` to restore original
- **Line-by-line rollback**: Use git to revert specific test methods if needed
- **Verification**: Run `npm test __tests__/utils/timer-helpers.test.tsx` to confirm rollback works

## Notes

### Implementation Notes:
- **Event loop fundamentals**: Microtasks (Promises) execute before macrotasks (timers) in JavaScript
- **Behavior vs implementation**: Test what functions do, not how they call internal APIs
- **Spy alternatives**: Use functional verification by checking timer behavior changes

### Follow-up Items:
- **Documentation**: Add event loop explanation to testing guidelines
- **Training**: Share insights about behavior-based testing vs spy-based testing
- **Future tests**: Apply behavior-based testing pattern to other utility tests
