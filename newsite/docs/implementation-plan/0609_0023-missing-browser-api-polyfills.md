# Implementation Plan: Missing Browser API Polyfills

**Branch**: `missing-browser-api-polyfills`  
**Created**: June 9, 2025 at 12:23 AM  
**ID**: 0609_0023

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All work for this implementation plan MUST be done on the `missing-browser-api-polyfills` branch.  
> Before starting any work, ensure you are on the correct branch: `git checkout missing-browser-api-polyfills`

## Background/Motivation

Our test suite is experiencing a 45% failure rate due to missing browser API polyfills in the Jest/JSDOM environment. The most critical issue is that `cancelAnimationFrame` is not defined, which causes immediate failure of all 22 homepage tests. Additionally, `requestAnimationFrame` implementation is inconsistent, and these polyfills aren't persisting through test cleanup cycles.

This implementation addresses the first and most critical item from the test environment limitations report, which blocks the largest number of tests and has the simplest solution path.

## Key Challenges

1. **Polyfill Persistence**: Current polyfills are being cleared during test cleanup, causing subsequent tests to fail
2. **JSDOM Limitations**: JSDOM doesn't provide these browser APIs by default, requiring manual implementation
3. **Test Isolation**: Need to ensure polyfills work correctly in parallel test execution without interfering with test isolation

## High-Level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Implement Basic Polyfills
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Write failing tests that demonstrate the missing APIs issue
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Add persistent RAF/cAF polyfills to jest.setup.js
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Verify polyfills persist through test cleanup cycles
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: Test that homepage tests no longer fail due to missing APIs

### Phase 2: Enhance Polyfill Robustness
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Write comprehensive tests for polyfill behavior
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Consider implementing raf-stub for more accurate frame timing
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Add polyfill health checks in beforeEach hooks
- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Document polyfill implementation for team reference

### Phase 3: Verify Test Suite Impact
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Run full test suite to measure improvement
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Document any remaining test failures
- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Update test environment documentation
- [ ] **Task 3.4**: Create follow-up tasks for remaining environment issues

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach:
1. Use setTimeout-based polyfills for basic implementation (16ms for ~60fps)
2. Ensure polyfills are reapplied in beforeEach hooks to handle cleanup
3. Consider raf-stub library for more sophisticated animation frame control
4. Follow TDD approach - write tests first, then implement solutions

### Key Requirements:
- Polyfills must persist through Jest's cleanup cycles
- Implementation must support parallel test execution
- Solution should not interfere with existing test isolation
- Must be compatible with React 19 and Jest's modern timer APIs

### Dependencies:
- Jest setup file (jest.setup.js)
- Testing library configuration
- Optional: raf-stub npm package for enhanced implementation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] All homepage tests (22 tests) no longer fail due to missing cancelAnimationFrame
- [ ] requestAnimationFrame and cancelAnimationFrame are available in all test environments
- [ ] Polyfills persist through test cleanup and work in parallel execution

### Quality Requirements:
- [ ] No new test failures introduced by polyfill implementation
- [ ] Clear documentation of polyfill behavior and limitations
- [ ] Implementation follows project coding standards

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] No significant impact on test execution time (<5% increase)
- [ ] Polyfills do not cause memory leaks in long test runs
- [ ] Solution works efficiently with parallel test execution on M2 MacBook
