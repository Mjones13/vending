# Implementation Plan: Smarter Vending Website Replica

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build an exact replica of https://smartervendinginc.com/ for internal or client use. This includes matching the design, layout, content, and functionality as closely as possible, while ensuring the codebase is maintainable and modern. The scope now includes all main internal pages and known subpages, with exact content and navigation fidelity.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Achieving pixel-perfect design fidelity with the reference site
- Reproducing all interactive elements (menus, sliders, forms, etc.)
- Ensuring responsiveness across devices
- Handling assets (images, icons, logos) and fonts
- Replicating navigation structure and page flows, including all subpages
- Implementing forms (e.g., contact, demo request, login)
- Accessibility and SEO considerations
- Copying all text and content exactly from the reference site
- Ensuring all navigation links work as on the reference site
- Handling dynamic or interactive elements (e.g., login, suggestion box)
- Verifying all content and navigation for accuracy

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] 1. Create a feature branch: `replicate-smarter-vending`
- [x] 2. Set up the project structure (Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)
- [x] 3. Scaffold main pages (Home, Coffee Services, Mini Markets, Vending Machines, About, Blog, Careers, Contact, Request Demo, Shop)
- [x] 4. Implement global layout (header, navigation, footer)
- [x] 5. Reproduce the Home page design and content
- [x] 6. Implement navigation and menu interactions
- [x] 7. Build out each subpage with matching content and design
- [x] 8. Add forms (Contact, Request Demo) with validation
- [x] 9. Integrate all images, icons, and assets
- [x] 10. Ensure full responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility
- [x] 11. Add accessibility and SEO best practices
- [x] 12. Test all functionality and design fidelity
- [x] 13. Prepare deployment scripts and documentation
- [ ] 14. Add/verify all main internal pages:
    - [ ] / (Home)
    - [ ] /coffee-services/
    - [ ] /mini-markets/
    - [ ] /vending-machines/
    - [ ] /about/
    - [ ] /careers/
    - [ ] /contact/
    - [ ] /blog/
    - [ ] /request-a-demo/
    - [ ] /login/
- [ ] 15. Add/verify all known subpages:
    - [ ] /coffee-services/ground-whole-bean/
    - [ ] /coffee-services/airpot-portion-packets/
    - [ ] /coffee-services/accessories/
- [ ] 16. Copy all content (text, structure, images) exactly from the reference site for each page and subpage
- [ ] 17. Update navigation to ensure all links work as on the reference site (including dropdowns/menus)
- [ ] 18. Verify navigation and content accuracy across all pages and subpages

## Acceptance Criteria
- All listed pages and subpages exist and are accessible via navigation
- All content (text, structure, images) matches the reference site exactly
- Navigation works as on the reference site, including dropdowns and submenus
- All forms and interactive elements function as expected
- Site is responsive and accessible
- All code and documentation are up to date

## Project Status Board
- [x] Planning and setup (complete)
- [x] Home page complete (scaffolded, ready for review)
- [x] Navigation/menu complete (scaffolded, ready for review)
- [x] All pages scaffolded (placeholders, build and lint pass)
- [x] Forms functional (client-side validation, success messages)
- [x] Assets integrated (placeholders, Home page)
- [x] Responsive and accessible (global styles)
- [x] Detailed design fidelity (refined styles)
- [x] Cross-browser tested & final review prep
- [ ] All main internal pages and subpages present with exact content
- [ ] Navigation and content verified for accuracy
- [ ] Ready for review

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
