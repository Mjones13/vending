# Implementation Plan: Fix Homepage Rotating Text Baseline Alignment

**Branch**: `fix-homepage-rotating-text-baseline-alignment`  
**Created**: June 11, 2025 at 03:50 AM  
**ID**: 0611_0350

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All work for this implementation plan MUST be done on the `fix-homepage-rotating-text-baseline-alignment` branch.  
> Before starting any work, ensure you are on the correct branch: `git checkout fix-homepage-rotating-text-baseline-alignment`

## Background/Motivation

The rotating text in the homepage hero section is not properly aligned with the static text baseline. Users reported that the word "Workplaces" and other rotating words appear misaligned with "Premium Amenity for Modern" text.

**Files Affected:**
- `pages/index.tsx` lines 594-622: CSS styling for `.rotating-text-container` and `.rotating-text`
- Existing comprehensive test suite in `__tests__/animations/rotating-text-alignment.test.tsx`

**Current vs Desired Behavior:**
- **Current**: Rotating words appear slightly offset vertically from the static text baseline
- **Desired**: All rotating words ("Workplaces", "Apartments", "Gyms", "Businesses") align perfectly with static text baseline

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Container positioning issue**: `vertical-align: baseline` and `top: 0.05em` correction aren't working properly (lines 601-604)
2. **Absolute positioning breaks baseline**: The `position: absolute` on rotating text disrupts natural baseline flow (lines 611-621)
3. **Font metrics inconsistency**: Different character widths causing inconsistent baseline calculations

## Key Challenges

1. **Technical Challenge**: Maintaining baseline alignment while preserving animation functionality in `pages/index.tsx` lines 594-622
2. **Testing Challenge**: Comprehensive alignment tests already exist that expect proper baseline alignment - must ensure all pass
3. **Integration Challenge**: Changes must not break existing rotating animation logic or responsive behavior

## Atomic Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Fix Rotating Text Container Baseline Alignment
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Fix rotating-text-container CSS properties for proper baseline alignment
  - **File**: `pages/index.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replace lines 594-605 CSS for `.rotating-text-container` to use `display: inline` and remove problematic `top: 0.05em`
  - **Verify**: `grep -n "rotating-text-container" pages/index.tsx` shows updated CSS properties
  
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Fix rotating-text positioning to maintain baseline flow  
  - **File**: `pages/index.tsx`
  - **Change**: Update lines 607-622 CSS for `.rotating-text` to use relative positioning instead of absolute
  - **Verify**: `grep -n "rotating-text[^-]" pages/index.tsx` shows updated positioning properties
  
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Start AI development server to test changes visually
  - **File**: Browser verification at `localhost:3001`
  - **Change**: Run `npm run start:ai` and navigate to homepage
  - **Verify**: Server responds successfully and homepage loads

### Phase 2: Test Alignment Across All Rotating Words
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Verify visual alignment of all rotating words
  - **File**: Browser testing at `localhost:3001`
  - **Change**: Observe "Workplaces", "Apartments", "Gyms", "Businesses" cycling through
  - **Verify**: All words appear aligned with "Premium Amenity for Modern" baseline

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Test responsive alignment on mobile viewports
  - **File**: Browser testing with developer tools
  - **Change**: Test alignment at 768px and 480px viewport widths
  - **Verify**: Text remains aligned at mobile breakpoints

### Phase 3: Run Automated Alignment Tests
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Execute rotating text alignment test suite
  - **File**: `__tests__/animations/rotating-text-alignment.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Run the comprehensive alignment test suite
  - **Verify**: `npm run test __tests__/animations/rotating-text-alignment.test.tsx` passes all tests

### Phase [FINAL]: **MANDATORY COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION** 🔍
> **CRITICAL**: This phase validates ALL previous work against original objectives.

- [ ] **Task [FINAL].1**: Verify Phase 1 Objectives Met
  - **Objective**: Fix rotating text container and positioning CSS for proper baseline alignment
  - **Verification**: 
    - [ ] Confirm Task 1.1 objective achieved: `.rotating-text-container` uses proper inline display and baseline alignment
    - [ ] Confirm Task 1.2 objective achieved: `.rotating-text` uses relative positioning to maintain baseline flow
    - [ ] Run comprehensive test: `grep -A 20 "rotating-text-container" pages/index.tsx` shows updated CSS
  - **Expected Result**: CSS changes implemented with proper baseline alignment properties

- [ ] **Task [FINAL].2**: Verify Phase 2 Objectives Met  
  - **Objective**: Confirm visual alignment works across all rotating words and responsive viewports
  - **Verification**:
    - [ ] Confirm Task 2.1 objective achieved: All rotating words visually align with static text
    - [ ] Confirm Task 2.2 objective achieved: Alignment maintained on mobile viewports
    - [ ] Run verification: Visual inspection at `localhost:3001` across different screen sizes
  - **Expected Result**: Perfect baseline alignment visible across all words and viewports

- [ ] **Task [FINAL].3**: Verify Phase 3 Objectives Met
  - **Objective**: Automated alignment tests pass confirming technical correctness
  - **Verification**:
    - [ ] Confirm Task 3.1 objective achieved: All alignment tests pass
    - [ ] Run verification: `npm run test __tests__/animations/rotating-text-alignment.test.tsx`
  - **Expected Result**: All baseline alignment tests pass without failures

- [ ] **Task [FINAL].4**: Validate Original Problem Resolution
  - **Original Problem**: Rotating words misaligned with static text baseline
  - **Verification**: 
    - [ ] Run original failing scenario: Visual inspection of rotating text alignment
    - [ ] Confirm problem symptoms are gone: No vertical offset between static and rotating text
    - [ ] Test edge cases: Animation transitions maintain alignment, font loading doesn't break alignment
  - **Expected Result**: "Workplaces" and other rotating words perfectly aligned with "Premium Amenity for Modern"

- [ ] **Task [FINAL].5**: Integration Testing
  - **Integration Points**: Homepage hero section animations, responsive layout system, existing test suite
  - **Verification**:
    - [ ] Full test suite passes: `npm test`
    - [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build:ai`
    - [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`
    - [ ] Animation cycling still works: Verify text continues rotating every 3 seconds
  - **Expected Result**: All systems work together without issues, alignment fixed without breaking functionality

- [ ] **Task [FINAL].6**: Document Implementation Results
  - **File**: `docs/scratchpad.md`
  - **Change**: Add comprehensive entry documenting:
    - [ ] Original problem: Rotating text baseline misalignment in homepage hero
    - [ ] Solution implemented: Fixed CSS in pages/index.tsx lines 594-622 for proper baseline alignment
    - [ ] Verification results: Visual alignment achieved, all tests pass
    - [ ] Any deviations from original plan
    - [ ] Lessons learned: Absolute positioning breaks baseline flow, use relative positioning instead
  - **Verify**: Entry exists with timestamp and complete information

### Verification Failure Protocol:
If any verification step fails:
1. **Analyze the failure** - Determine root cause of verification failure
2. **Document the issue** - Note what failed and why in implementation plan
3. **Choose response**:
   - **Simple fix**: Create additional task to address the issue
   - **Complex issue**: STOP and notify user with:
     - Specific failure details
     - What was attempted
     - Potential solutions identified
     - Request for guidance on how to proceed
4. **Do NOT mark plan complete** until all verifications pass
