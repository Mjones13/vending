# Implementation Plan: JSDOM Alternatives Evaluation

**Branch**: `jsdom-alternatives-evaluation`  
**Created**: June 9, 2025 at 03:40 AM  
**ID**: 0609_0340

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All work for this implementation plan MUST be done on the `jsdom-alternatives-evaluation` branch.  
> Before starting any work, ensure you are on the correct branch: `git checkout jsdom-alternatives-evaluation`

## Background/Motivation

The current test environment uses JSDOM which has significant limitations that are blocking proper testing of animations, transitions, and browser-specific features. This evaluation will compare alternatives to determine the best path forward.

**Current JSDOM Limitations (from test-environment-limitations-solutions.md):**
- No CSS animation support - animations always report as 'not running'
- Performance issues with large test suites - slow test execution
- Incomplete browser API implementation - missing many modern APIs
- Heavy polyfill overhead - complex setup required for basic features

**Affected Files:**
- `jest.setup.js` - Current JSDOM configuration and polyfills
- `jest.config.js` - Test environment configuration
- All animation tests in `__tests__/animations/` - Currently limited by JSDOM
- Component tests that rely on browser APIs

**Desired Outcome:**
- Identify the best alternative to JSDOM (Happy-DOM vs Vitest Browser Mode)
- Create proof-of-concept implementations for both alternatives
- Measure performance impact and API compatibility
- Provide recommendation with migration path

## Key Challenges

1. **Technical Challenge**: Migrating existing test infrastructure without breaking current tests
   - Jest configuration changes needed for Happy-DOM
   - Complete migration from Jest to Vitest if choosing Browser Mode
   - Existing polyfills may conflict with new environments

2. **Testing Challenge**: Ensuring all existing tests continue to pass with new environment
   - Some tests may rely on JSDOM-specific quirks
   - Animation tests need to be validated against real behavior
   - Performance benchmarking needed to compare alternatives

3. **Integration Challenge**: Compatibility with existing testing utilities and patterns
   - React Testing Library compatibility
   - Custom test utilities in `test-utils/`
   - CI/CD pipeline adjustments may be needed

  - **Verify**: Entry exists with timestamp and complete evaluation data

### Verification Failure Protocol:
If any verification step fails:
1. **Analyze the failure** - Determine root cause of verification failure
2. **Document the issue** - Note what failed and why in implementation plan
3. **Choose response**:
   - **Simple fix**: Create additional task to address the issue
   - **Complex issue**: STOP and notify user with:
     - Specific failure details
     - What was attempted
     - Potential solutions identified
     - Request for guidance on how to proceed
4. **Do NOT mark plan complete** until all verifications pass

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach:
- **Parallel Evaluation**: Set up both Happy-DOM and Vitest Browser Mode as separate POCs
- **Consistent Benchmarking**: Use identical test suites and metrics for fair comparison
- **Incremental Testing**: Start with simple tests, progress to complex animation tests
- **Data-Driven Decision**: Base recommendation on objective performance and compatibility data

### Evaluation Criteria:
1. **Performance**: Test execution speed compared to JSDOM baseline
2. **Compatibility**: How many existing tests pass without modification
3. **Feature Support**: CSS animations, browser APIs, modern JavaScript
4. **Migration Effort**: Configuration changes, syntax changes, tooling changes
5. **Maintenance**: Community support, documentation, update frequency

### Atomic Task Guidelines:
- **One File Rule**: Each task modifies exactly ONE file (or creates ONE new file)
- **Line Specificity**: Include line numbers when modifying existing code
- **Exact Changes**: Specify exact text/code to add, remove, or replace
- **Clear Verification**: Each task has unambiguous completion criteria
- **Sequential Order**: Tasks must be completed in the specified order
- **Final Verification Required**: EVERY plan ends with comprehensive verification phase

### File Organization:
**New Files to Create:**
- `scripts/benchmark-jsdom.js` - JSDOM performance baseline
- `scripts/benchmark-happy-dom.js` - Happy-DOM performance test
- `scripts/benchmark-vitest.js` - Vitest performance test
- `jest.config.happy-dom.js` - Happy-DOM Jest configuration
- `jest.setup.happy-dom.js` - Happy-DOM setup file
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `docs/test-environment-comparison.md` - Feature comparison matrix
- `docs/jsdom-alternatives-analysis.md` - Final analysis report
- `docs/migration-guide-[solution].md` - Migration instructions

**Files to Modify:**
- `package.json` - Add new dev dependencies
- `references/test-environment-limitations-solutions.md` - Add evaluation results
- `docs/scratchpad.md` - Document findings and lessons learned

### Dependencies:
- **Happy-DOM**: `happy-dom@latest` (currently v15.x)
- **Vitest**: `vitest@latest`, `@vitest/browser@latest`, `playwright@latest`
- **Node.js**: Requires Node 18+ for both alternatives
- **Task Dependencies**: 
  - Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2 & 3 (need baseline data)
  - Phase 2 & 3 can run in parallel
  - Phase 4 requires completion of Phase 2 & 3
  - Final verification requires all phases complete

  - **Verify with**: `npm test __tests__/test-environment/jsdom-limitations.test.ts`
- [ ] Happy-DOM POC successfully runs existing test suite subset
  - **Verify with**: `npm test -- --config=jest.config.happy-dom.js __tests__/components/Layout.test.tsx`
- [ ] Vitest Browser Mode POC demonstrates real browser testing
  - **Verify with**: `npx vitest run __tests__/vitest-poc/`
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show measurable differences
  - **Verify with**: `ls scripts/benchmark-*.js | xargs -I {} node {}`

### Quality Requirements:  
- [ ] All POC code follows existing code standards
  - **Verify with**: `npm run lint` passes without errors
- [ ] Documentation is clear and actionable
  - **Verify with**: Migration guide includes step-by-step instructions
- [ ] No impact on existing test infrastructure

- [ ] Performance benchmark data (execution time, memory usage)
- [ ] Migration complexity assessment (LOC changes, config changes)
- [ ] Clear recommendation with justification
- [ ] Migration guide for recommended solution

### Final Verification Requirements:
- [ ] **ALL original objectives achieved** (verified in Final Phase)
- [ ] **Original problem completely resolved** (tested and confirmed)  
- [ ] **No regressions introduced** (full integration testing passed)
- [ ] **Implementation documented** (scratchpad.md updated with complete solution)

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Verification:
- [ ] All tasks marked complete with checkboxes
- [ ] All verification commands pass
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met

### Final Verification Success:
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Final verification phase completed successfully
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Original problem no longer reproducible
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: All integration points tested and working
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Solution documented for future reference

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues:
1. **Package Version Conflicts**: Happy-DOM or Vitest may conflict with existing dependencies
   - **Mitigation**: Install in isolation, use exact versions, test incrementally
   
2. **Test Syntax Incompatibility**: Vitest uses different syntax than Jest
   - **Mitigation**: Create wrapper utilities to minimize syntax changes if needed
   
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Issues**: New test runners may not work in CI environment
   - **Mitigation**: Document CI requirements early, test in CI-like environment

4. **Performance Regression**: Alternative might be slower than JSDOM for some tests
   - **Mitigation**: Profile specific slow tests, consider hybrid approach

### Rollback Plan:
- All changes are isolated in new files (configs, POC tests)
- Original Jest/JSDOM setup remains untouched
- To rollback: Simply don't merge the POC files to main
- No risk to existing test infrastructure during evaluation

## Notes

### Implementation Notes:
- Run benchmarks multiple times to account for variance
- Test with both small and large test suites for accurate comparison  
- Consider developer experience (debugging, error messages) in evaluation
- Document any workarounds needed for each alternative

### Follow-up Items:
- After choosing alternative, create full migration plan
- Consider keeping JSDOM for specific test cases if needed (hybrid approach)
- Investigate Playwright Component Testing as another alternative
- Plan for team training on new testing approach
