# Implementation Plan: AI Agent Push Workflow Optimization

## Background/Motivation

AI agents (Claude, Claude Code, Kirshir) currently experience timeout issues when pushing code changes because:
1. The pre-push hook runs comprehensive tests that can take 60-90 seconds
2. The default Bash tool timeout is 2 minutes (120 seconds), leaving little margin for error
3. When tests fail or hang, the push operation times out, requiring manual intervention
4. AI agents should never need to use `--no-verify` to bypass tests

This implementation plan addresses these issues by creating AI-specific testing workflows with appropriate timeouts and faster test execution paths.

## Key Challenges

1. **Timeout Management**: The default 2-minute timeout for Bash commands is insufficient for comprehensive test suites
2. **Test Execution Time**: Full pre-push validation can take 60-90 seconds when passing, longer when failing
3. **Workflow Clarity**: AI agents need clear instructions on proper push procedures with timeout specifications

## High-Level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Add AI-Specific Test Commands
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Add `test:ai:pre-push` command to package.json
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Add `push:ai:validated` command to package.json
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Test the new commands to ensure they work correctly

### Phase 2: Update Documentation
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Update CLAUDE.md with AI Agent Push Workflow section
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Document timeout requirements for each command
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Add troubleshooting section for common push issues

### Phase 3: Validation and Testing
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Test the complete workflow with actual push operations
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Verify timeout handling works as expected
- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Document any edge cases or additional considerations

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach:
1. Create AI-specific npm scripts that run a subset of tests optimized for speed
2. Use `--bail` flag to fail fast on first error
3. Document explicit timeout values for AI agents to use with Bash tool
4. Provide both separate and combined commands for flexibility

### Key Requirements:
- AI agents must never need to use `--no-verify`
- Push operations must complete without timing out
- Test feedback must be clear and actionable
- Commands must be documented in CLAUDE.md

### Dependencies:
- Existing test infrastructure (Jest, Playwright)
- npm-run-all2 for parallel script execution
- Current pre-push hook configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] `test:ai:pre-push` runs lint, type-check, unit, and integration tests with --bail
- [ ] `push:ai:validated` runs tests then pushes if successful
- [ ] Commands complete within specified timeout windows

### Quality Requirements:
- [ ] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Error messages guide AI agents to correct solutions
- [ ] No regression in existing workflows

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] AI pre-push tests complete in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Combined push workflow completes in under 5 minutes
- [ ] Fast failure on first error (--bail flag working)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Implementation plan creation | ✅ Complete | Plan created with timestamp ID 0608_2111 |
| Requirements analysis | ✅ Complete | Clear requirements from user |
| Phase 1 preparation | ⏳ Pending | Ready to begin implementation |

### Next Steps:
1. Create git branch `ai-agent-push-workflow-optimization`
2. Implement Phase 1 tasks (add npm scripts)
3. Test the new commands locally

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Ready to begin implementation. The plan is straightforward and should solve the timeout issues experienced by AI agents.
