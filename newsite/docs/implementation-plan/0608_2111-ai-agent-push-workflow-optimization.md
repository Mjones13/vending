# Implementation Plan: AI Agent Push Workflow Optimization

## Background/Motivation

AI agents (Claude, Claude Code, Kirshir) currently experience timeout issues when pushing code changes because:
1. The pre-push hook runs comprehensive tests that can take 60-90 seconds
2. The default Bash tool timeout is 2 minutes (120 seconds), leaving little margin for error
3. When tests fail or hang, the push operation times out, requiring manual intervention
4. AI agents should never need to use `--no-verify` to bypass tests

This implementation plan addresses these issues by creating AI-specific testing workflows with appropriate timeouts and faster test execution paths.

## Key Challenges

1. **Timeout Management**: The default 2-minute timeout for Bash commands is insufficient for comprehensive test suites
2. **Test Execution Time**: Full pre-push validation can take 60-90 seconds when passing, longer when failing
3. **Workflow Clarity**: AI agents need clear instructions on proper push procedures with timeout specifications
4. **Error Recovery**: When tests fail, AI agents need actionable guidance on fixing issues

## High-Level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Add AI-Specific Test Commands ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Add `test:ai:pre-push` command to package.json
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Add `push:ai:validated` command to package.json
- [x] **Task 1.3**: Add `push:ai` as an alias for git push with proper timeout
- [x] **Task 1.4**: Test the new commands to ensure they work correctly

### Phase 2: Update Documentation ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Update CLAUDE.md with AI Agent Push Workflow section
- [x] **Task 2.2**: Document timeout requirements for each command
- [x] **Task 2.3**: Add example Bash tool usage with proper timeout values
- [x] **Task 2.4**: Add troubleshooting section for common push issues

### Phase 3: Validation and Testing ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Task 3.1**: Test the complete workflow with actual push operations
- [x] **Task 3.2**: Verify timeout handling works as expected
- [x] **Task 3.3**: Test error scenarios (failing tests, network issues)
- [x] **Task 3.4**: Document any edge cases or additional considerations
- [x] **Task 3.5**: Update scratchpad.md with lessons learned

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach:
1. Create AI-specific npm scripts that run a subset of tests optimized for speed
2. Use `--bail` flag to fail fast on first error
3. Use `run-p` for parallel execution of lint, type-check, and tests
4. Document explicit timeout values for AI agents to use with Bash tool:
   - Test runs: 3 minutes (180000ms)
   - Push operations: 4 minutes (240000ms)
   - Combined operations: 4 minutes (240000ms)
5. Provide both separate and combined commands for flexibility
6. Consider creating a custom script that provides real-time feedback during long operations

### Key Requirements:
- AI agents must never need to use `--no-verify`
- Push operations must complete without timing out
- Test feedback must be clear and actionable
- Commands must be documented in CLAUDE.md

### Dependencies:
- Existing test infrastructure (Jest, Playwright)
- npm-run-all2 for parallel script execution
- Current pre-push hook configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] `test:ai:pre-push` runs lint, type-check, unit, and integration tests in parallel with --bail
- [ ] `push:ai:validated` runs tests then pushes if successful
- [ ] `push:ai` provides a simple alias for git push with appropriate timeout
- [ ] Commands complete within specified timeout windows
- [ ] Clear error messages when tests fail to guide fixes

### Quality Requirements:
- [ ] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Error messages guide AI agents to correct solutions
- [ ] No regression in existing workflows

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] AI pre-push tests complete in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Combined push workflow completes in under 4 minutes
- [ ] Fast failure on first error (--bail flag working)
